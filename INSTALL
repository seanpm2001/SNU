Installing this SNU project by @seanpm2001

This project currently doesn't have to be installed to be viewed, and currently doesn't require installation, it is a basic website project that is compliant with web standards, so it should work in any web browser that respects WHATWG. It does need to be downloaded first.

If you want to load the web pages, you will need to have an HTML5 framework installed (version 5.0 or higher) and the packages for any programming languages included.

The current included programming languages include:

> HTML 5.3 (5.0 or higher required, won't work as well with HTML 4.0.1 and lower)
> CSS 3 (might work with CSS 2.0 but with less performance, may not work with CSS 1.x)
> JavaScript (1.8 or higher, may work well with any version of JavaScript below 1.8)
> PHP (optional, version 7.3 or higher, 7.0 minimum, 6.0 and below may not work as well or at all)
> Ruby (optional, version 2.6 or higher, 1.8 minimum, versions before 1.8 may not work as well or at all)

If the project contains image files

If you want to view the image files, the majority of files are in JPG/PNG format. Make sure your computer can handle images of 2560x1440/2560x1080 resolution well, and that your computer can handle JPG files.

Some image files are in other formats, such as SVG, TIFF, TIF, BMP, JFIF, GIF, and PNG. You will need support for viewing these files to view these files.

Some included files are in Markdown format (*.md) for best viewing, you should use a markdown viewer/markdown editor.

Some included files are in PDF format. They should be opened with a document viewer capable of handling PDF documents.

NOTE: It is recommended to read the full docs for SNU, rather than this file, as it is not complete yet. View better instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/745564a46186888e829fdeb9cda584de) a bit dated, but they still work, they also need to be updated.
