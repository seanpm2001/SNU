# Need help ripping the new Google sites

I need help ripping the "new" Google sites. The earliest forms of SNU are within my old Google site, and there is no way so far that I have found to successfully rip the entire site. It is part of my own account, yet it can't be downloaded via Google takeout, which is a clear violation of certain international laws. The methods I have tried are:

> * Google takeout - The download option doesn't exist, only the old Google sites option does

> * Using HTTrack - This rips all the files, but opening any of them will just redirect to the main page, plus a lot of data is missing as well.

If you know any ways of ripping this website, please let me know. I will award you with free intermediate technical support for a month, along with some other rewards if I can get an answer.
