### About

This is the first GitHub release of the master SNU module. This release is incomplete, and was published 1 day late. It contains most of the important files, but the modules have to be added separately.

I have fixed a couple issues in this release, and also finished adding in all the SNU trend files, along with:

> * The addition of a `README.md` file

> * The addition of a new file extension for the main license
