0D mode (0 dimensional mode) is a joke mode of SNU. Since it is not possible to display 0 dimensional objects, this mode is just a single page talking about why this is not possible. The page background is the PNG transparency checker pattern, trying to imply that the mode is dimensionless. It is the lowest dimensional mode of SNU, right below the first functional dimensional mode, which is [1 dimensional mode](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU/wiki/1D-mode/)

0D mode is considered an Easter Egg of SNU. It is very small, taking up less than 80 kilobytes. As such, it is not recommended to take it out, unless absolutely necessary.
